Software related to the wider PANOPTES network that ties the individual units together.
This is a repository to host the various Google Cloud Platform services.

Each subfolder defines a different service. 

Each service is either a [Cloud Function](https://cloud.google.com/functions) or a [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) instance, however all services are defined as web services that respond to HTTP JSON requests.

Most services do not allow unauthenticated requests. Services largely communicate with each other via [PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/) messages.

See the README for a specific service for more details. See the [Services](#services) section for a list of services.

# Data Model

> :construction: Todo: Replace this section with easy graphic and then link to detailed document with this information.

Data is organized by the object type:

```md
# Data Model
Units
  Mount
  Sensors
  Cameras
    Observations
        Images

```

Data is stored in [Google Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) database with a flat structure:

```md
# Data Storage
images
observations
units
processed_observations
lightcurves
```

### Data Descriptions
<a href="#" id="data-descriptions"></a>

> :warning: Note: PANOPTES data is stored in [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), which is a NoSQL database.
Unlike a traditional database, this means that there is no guarantee that a certain field will be present. As part of our processing we try to guarantee that the fields listed below are always present, however the document may also contain additional fields not documented here.

#### Unit

Collection: `units`  
Document ID: `unit_id`

```json
{
    PAN001: {
        name: "PAN001",
        elevation: 3400.0,      # meters
        location: {             # stored as GeoPoint
            latitude: 19.54,    # degrees
            longitude: -155.58  # degrees
        },
        status: "active"
    }
}
```

#### Observation

An observation is a sequence of images from a single camera taken from a single unit during one continuous
tracking movement. Any movement of the mount (e.g. a meridian flip) will stop the current observation, even if
the same target is observed next. Ideally a unit will have at least two simulataneous observations at any
given time (one for each camera).

Observations are organized by a `sequence_id` of the form: 

`<UNIT_ID>_<CAMERA_ID>_<SEQUENCE_START_TIME>`.

Collection: `observations`  
Document ID: `sequence_id`

```json
{
    PAN001_14d3bd_20180216T110623: {
        unit_id: "PAN001",
        camera_id: "14d3bd",
        software_version: "POCSv0.6.0",
        ra: 135.859993568,
        dec: 28.4376569571,
        exptime: 120
        status: "receiving_files",
        time: DatetimeWithNanoseconds(2018, 2, 16, 11, 6, 23, tzinfo=<UTC>),
    }
}
```

#### Image

An image corresponds to a single image from a single camera.

Images are organized by an `image_id` of the form: 

`<UNIT_ID>_<CAMERA_ID>_<IMAGE_START_TIME>`.

Collection: `images`  
Document ID: `image_id`

```json
{
PAN001_14d3bd_20180216T112430: {
    ha_mnt: 1.919988307895942,       # From the mount
    ra_mnt: 133.1505416666667,       # From the mount
    dec_mnt: 28.33138888888889,      # From the mount
    ra_image: 135.884026231,         # From plate solve

    sequence_id: "PAN001_14d3bd_20180216T110623",
    status: "uploaded"
    time: DatetimeWithNanoseconds(2018, 2, 16, 11, 24, 30, tzinfo=<UTC>),
  }    
}
```

#### Star

Stellar information is identified by the PANOPTES Input Catalog ID (PICID) and consists of processed runs
of a single observation. An observation could be processed in multiple ways by the processing run.

Note that the PICID corresponds the the [TESS Input Catalog ID (TICID)](https://archive.stsci.edu/tess/) and thus the same number can be used
as a lookup on many public sites.

#### Lightcurve

# Services
<a href="#" id="services"></a>

There are a few different categories of services that are in use on the panoptes-network.

| Service                                        | Trigger | Description                                                     |

| [`image-uploaded`](image-uploaded/README.md)   | Bucket  | Simple foward to next service based on file type.               |
| [`compress-fits`](compress-fits/README.md)     | PubSub  | Compresses all `.fits` to `.fits.fz`.                           |
| [`make-rgb-fits`](make-rgb-fits/README.md)     | PubSub  | Makes interpolated RGB `.fits` from `.CR2` file.                |
| [`record-image`](record-image/README.md)       | PubSub  | Records header and metadata from `.fits.fz` files.              |

| [`get-fits-header`](get-fits-header/README.md) | Http    | Returns the FITS headers for a given file.                      |

## Deploying services
<a href="#" id="deploying-services"></a>
<a href="#" id="deploy"></a>

You can deploy any service using `bin/deploy` from the top level directory. The
command takes the service name as a parameter:

```bash
$ bin/deploy record-image
```
## Creating new services

> Todo: More here.

Services are either written in Python or JavaScript.
