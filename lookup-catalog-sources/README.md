Lookup Catalog Sources
======================

This folder defines a [Google Cloud Function](https://cloud.google.com/functions/).

This function is used to look up stellar sources from the PANOPTES catalog.

This endpoint looks for one parameter, `bucket_path`. If `bucket_path` is present 
then it will be checked for a World Coordinate System (WCS). This WCS will be used to look
up the catalog sources for the entire observation. The matching sources, along with
the corresponding XY-pixel positions for the image, are saved back to the processing
bucket to be used for source extraction.


Endpoint: `/lookup-catalog-sources`

Payload: 
JSON message of the form:

```json
{
  bucket_path: str,
}
```
